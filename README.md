# NLP-Spam-Classifier

Used deep learning to classify emails as spam and not spam.

I used information retreival features to trim the huge input dataset and instead of going for stemming, I did lemmatization as it takes the context of the text into account. All this acts as a good pathway for the machine learning model that gets set up later on.

In the end, I used the random forest and linear regression classifiers to test how well the model performed, and to also see which classifier was a better indicator.
