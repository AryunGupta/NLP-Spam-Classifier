# NLP-Spam-Classifier

Used deep learning to classify emails as spam and not spam.
I used information retreival features to trim the huge input dataset and make it useful to train the model.
I used the random forest and linear regression classifiers to test how well the model performed, and to also see which classifier was a better indicator.
